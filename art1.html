        <h3 class="subtitle">What is Dark Matter?</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Dark matter is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects. It is estimated to constitute about 27% of the universe, with ordinary matter accounting for just 5%, and dark energy making up the rest.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Evidence of Dark Matter</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>The concept of dark matter emerged from observations of galaxy rotations. In the 1970s, astronomers Vera Rubin and Kent Ford discovered that the outer regions of galaxies were rotating as fast as the inner regions, defying Newtonian physics. This led to the hypothesis of an unseen mass exerting gravitational forces.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Role of Dark Matter</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Dark matter is essential for explaining the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures in the universe. It acts as a gravitational scaffold, pulling regular matter into the dense regions where galaxies and stars form. Without dark matter, the universe would not have the same structure and complexity we observe today.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Current Research and Challenges</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Despite its importance, dark matter remains one of the greatest mysteries in cosmology. Researchers are exploring various theories and conducting experiments to detect dark matter particles. One promising candidate is the WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle), though it has yet to be detected.</h3>
