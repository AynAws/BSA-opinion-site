        <br>
        <h3>Mars has long been a focal point for space exploration. NASA's Perseverance rover is currently investigating the planet's surface, searching for signs of ancient life. Plans for manned missions to Mars are underway, with NASA aiming for the 2030s. Elon Musk's SpaceX is also working on its Starship rocket, with the goal of establishing a human settlement on Mars.</h3>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Space Tourism</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are pioneering space tourism. These companies aim to make space travel more accessible, offering suborbital flights and potential orbital trips for civilians. The recent successful flights of Blue Origin’s New Shepard and Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity mark significant milestones in this emerging industry.</h3>

        <h3 class="subtitle">International Collaboration</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>International collaboration is key to the future of space exploration. The International Space Station (ISS) is a prime example of successful cooperation among space agencies. Projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's ExoMars mission highlight the importance of global partnerships in advancing our understanding of space.</h3>
