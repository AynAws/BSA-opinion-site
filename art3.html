        <h3 class="subtitle">What are Exoplanets?</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. The first confirmed discovery of an exoplanet occurred in 1992, and since then, the number of known exoplanets has grown exponentially. These planets vary widely in size, composition, and distance from their parent stars.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Methods of Detection</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Several methods are used to detect exoplanets, the most common being the transit method and the radial velocity method. The transit method measures the dimming of a star as a planet passes in front of it, while the radial velocity method detects the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.</h3>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Habitable Zone</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>One of the key factors in the search for life is the habitable zone, the region around a star where conditions may be right for liquid water to exist. Planets within this zone, often referred to as "Goldilocks" planets, are prime candidates for hosting life.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Notable Discoveries</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Several exoplanets have garnered significant attention for their potential habitability. Proxima Centauri b, located in the habitable zone of the closest star to the Sun, and TRAPPIST-1e, one of seven Earth-sized planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, are among the most intriguing discoveries.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3 class="subtitle">The Role of Space Telescopes</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Space telescopes like the Kepler Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) have revolutionized our understanding of exoplanets. The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will further enhance our ability to study exoplanet atmospheres and search for signs of life.</h3>
